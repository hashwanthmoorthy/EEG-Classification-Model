In the fields of neuroscience and medicine, electroencephalography (EEG) is a df
non-invasive method that is extremely useful for observing the dynamic activity of the
human brain. The technique uses electrodes applied to the scalp to record electrical
signals produced by brain neurons. The synchronised electrical activity of neural
networks is represented by these signals, also referred to as brainwaves, which are
essential to comprehend a variety of physiological and cognitive processes.
EEG data is now widely used in clinical and research settings, greatly advancing our
knowledge of how the brain works, aiding in the diagnosis of neurological conditions,
and enabling the tracking of brain health. Researchers and medical professionals
have found EEG to be a useful tool for examining sleep patterns, cognitive functions,
neurological conditions, and even mental states.
EEG is unique in that it can measure brain activity in real-time with millisecond
accuracy due to its temporal resolution. It is possible to identify quick neural events
and correlate them with internal cognitive processes or external stimuli thanks to this
temporal precision. Furthermore, the non-invasive nature of EEG makes it an ideal
option for observing brain activity in a variety of populations, including adults,
children, and people with a range of medical conditions.
Recent technological developments and improvements in data analysis methods
have raised the bar for EEG research. Artificial intelligence and machine learning
combined have made it possible to conduct more complex analyses and increased
the precision of EEG-based applications. Creating models that can categorize EEG
data into distinct groups is one use for these models.
